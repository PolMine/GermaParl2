## About - Documentation and Feedback

The GermaParl2 corpus provides all parliamentary debates of the German Bundestag from 1949 to 2021 in a comprehensively annotated format. The corpus is available as a CWB corpus and as TEI-inspired XML on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10416536). In this repository, the documentation of GermaParl v2 is stored and provided as a [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) document. The documentation is available at: https://polmine.github.io/GermaParl2/.

In addition, we use this repository to gather feedback on the GermaParl v2 corpus. Creating a so-called issue in this repository to report remaining bugs and flaws in the data and suggest new features is a great way to contribute to the resource. We really appreciate any feedback you might be able to provide for both the TEI/XML version and the CWB version of the corpus. We will use issues to structure upcoming releases of the resource.

On GitHub, the creation of issues is described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue).
